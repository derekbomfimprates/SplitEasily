# SplitEasily

This application was created to support the users during a collective trip to split the amount spent. 
A SaaS, Software As A Service, was built to split the cost of trips and share them across a team.
The system has a Java backend and a REACT Native mobile application front end.

The application allows people to create a label, name of the trip, and store information referring to the trip, that is, all the expenses that each person had during the trip. It is possible to consult all costs at any time of the trip and close the trip. At the end of the trip, the application presents a report with all the information about the trip and the amount that must be paid to each member. Then, in the end, all expenses will be divided equally among the members of the trip.
